# You Are Pizza
### About
You Are Pizza is not about finding pizzerias, but about keeping track of all the pizza you have tried. I got the idea from a phrase about you are what you eat and I like to eat pizza. I was also lucky enough for [Gustavo Zambelli](https://dribbble.com/zamax) to provide all the pizza images for the project.

### Technologies Used
* Express/Node.js
* Sequelize for PostgreSQL
* Yelp API
* HTML5 Geolocation
* Google Maps Javascript API
* Google Maps Geocoding API
* Instagram API
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

### Approach Taken
[Wireframes and ERDs](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/ga-pizza/tree/master/screenshots)
I wanted to make sure the user had several options besides the HTML5 geolocation for searching because I do not allow several websites to get my current location. I spent a lot of time struggling to add a delete button to remove data from the join table. I put CSS as a low priority and was rushed in the end because of that delay. After the main CSS was done I spent the rest of the time tinkering with the profile section.

### Unsolved Problems
* Google Maps Geocoding API sometimes does not work if a common address is entered without a city.

## Upcoming Additions
* Improved How It Works section.
* Edit CSS for alerts.
* Mark current location to Google Maps, so I could use the Directions Service.
* Add 404 page.
* Add favorite section in addition to all places visited.
